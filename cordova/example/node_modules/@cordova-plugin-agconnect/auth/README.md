   Most apps need to identify and authenticate users to tailor the app experience for individual users. However, building such a system from scratch is a difficult process. Auth Service can quickly build a secure and reliable user authentication system for your app. You only need to access Auth Service capabilities in your app without caring about the facilities and implementation on the cloud.
